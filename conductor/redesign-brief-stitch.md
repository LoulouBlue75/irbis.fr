# IRBIS — Redesign Brief for Stitch

---

## CONTEXT

**Irbis Partners** — Premium executive search firm, Paris.

Named after the **snow leopard** (irbis in Russian). Rare, powerful, elusive. Thrives where others can't.

**What we do:** Recruit C-level executives and rare specialists for ambitious organizations.

**Our belief:** "High standards. Shared ambition." We don't just search — we challenge, we spar, we step into the arena with our clients.

**Tone:** Demanding but human. Methodical but warm. Confident, never arrogant.

## DESIGN AMBITION

**I want a site that feels:**
- Serious but not cold
- Premium but not flashy
- Bold but not loud
- Modern but timeless

**Visual approach:**
- Minimal — only what's necessary
- Large images — full-bleed, immersive, striking
- Big typography — headlines that command attention
- Generous whitespace — confidence in emptiness
- White background as base

**Let the design breathe.** Each section should feel like a moment.

**Photography direction:** Meaningful images, not stock clichés. No handshakes, no suits smiling. Think: perspective, light, architecture, nature, elevation.

---

## CONSTRAINTS

1. **Logo everywhere** — header + footer, every page
2. **Same header/footer on all pages**
3. **4 nav links only** — Approach, Executive Search, References, Contact
4. **No clutter** — when in doubt, remove
5. **White background base**

---

## FREEDOM

- **Colors:** You decide. Find a palette that feels premium and modern.
- **Typography:** You decide. Pair fonts that create impact.
- **Layout:** You decide. Be audacious, asymmetric, editorial.
- **Imagery style:** You decide. Set a mood that matches the ambition.
- **Graphic elements:** You decide. Minimal or bold, your call.

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

Someone lands on the site and thinks:
- "This is different."
- "These people are serious."
- "I want to know more."

---

**You have the structure. You have the context. Now design something remarkable.**
