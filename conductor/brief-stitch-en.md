# IRBIS Partners — Design Brief

---

## THE COMPANY

**Irbis Partners** is a premium executive search firm based in Paris, France. The website is **www.irbis.fr**.

We specialize in recruiting C-level executives, leadership roles, and rare specialists for ambitious organizations who refuse to settle for mediocre hires.

**The name "Irbis"** comes from the snow leopard — a rare, powerful, and elusive predator that thrives in the most demanding environments. This animal embodies our approach: precision, discretion, and excellence.

---

## THE ECOSYSTEM

Irbis Partners operates three interconnected platforms:

1. **IRBIS Executive Search** — The flagship service. End-to-end executive recruitment for critical leadership positions.

2. **Tailor Shift** — A dedicated platform for luxury retail recruitment. Boutique directors, department managers, and sales advisors for prestigious fashion houses, watchmakers, and jewelers.

3. **Paris** — A career guidance platform where professionals can discover their unique profile through our 8D assessment methodology.

---

## THE METHODOLOGY

We developed the **8D Alignment** methodology — a proprietary framework that evaluates fit across 8 dimensions:

1. Competencies
2. Leadership Style
3. Trajectory
4. Values
5. Potential
6. Culture
7. Adaptability
8. Vision

This is not a checklist. It's a structured way to understand human complexity and ensure lasting placements.

## THE PHILOSOPHY

**"High standards. Shared ambition."** — This is our tagline.

We believe:
- Executive search should be a **sparring partnership**, not a transactional service
- We **challenge the brief** before accepting it — to protect the decision
- Technology should **amplify human judgment**, never replace it
- Confidentiality is not a feature, it's **designed into the system**

We call our approach: **"Stepping into the arena together."**

We don't hide behind process. We own the outcome.

## DESIGN RULES

1. **One gold button per screen maximum.** All other actions are text links.

2. **Headlines: 5 words maximum.** Body text: 12 words maximum.

3. **Generous whitespace.** The empty space is intentional.

4. **No stock photos** of people in suits shaking hands.

5. **No gradients, no flashy effects.** Calm, controlled, premium.

6. **Hierarchy is everything.** One focal point per section.

## REFERENCES (Spirit, not copy)

## WHAT I WANT

A homepage that:
- Feels like a top-tier consulting firm, not a SaaS startup
- Says little but communicates power and precision
- Uses gold sparingly (it's precious)
- Makes you want to scroll and explore
- Inspires trust and ambition

---

## WHAT I DON'T WANT

- Cluttered header with 10 navigation links
- Multiple gold buttons competing for attention
- Verbose explanatory text
- Generic "innovative solutions" language
- Template SaaS aesthetic
- Busy layouts with no breathing room
