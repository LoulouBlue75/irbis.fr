# IRBIS — Addendum: Co‑Ambition, Elevation & “In the Arena” (English‑first)

This is a refinement layer to integrate a crucial truth:
**Irbis shares the ambition of its clients, steps into the arena with them, and acts as a sparring partner — demanding and benevolent.**
(No quotes, no borrowed lyrics — just the spirit: present, engaged, accountable.)

---

## 1) Updated brand truth (tight)

### One‑sentence definition (revised)
**Irbis is a leadership search and decision partner for high‑stakes hires — rigorous in method, deeply human in judgement, and fully engaged alongside founders and decision‑makers.**

### What changes (in one line)
We’re not “hands‑off advisors.”  
**We step in. We challenge. We carry the ambition with you.**

---

## 2) Updated positioning (hub‑level)

### Positioning line (new options)
Choose one as the flagship line on irbis.fr:

1) **High standards. Shared ambition.**  
2) **Method. Presence. Elevation.**  
3) **In the arena, with you.**  
4) **Demanding on decisions. Kind with people.**  
5) **Clarity for leaders who build.**

### Two‑line positioning statement (revised)
**Irbis supports decisive appointments for leaders building organisations that must rise.**  
We combine disciplined method, human presence, and AI‑assisted clarity — with humility about complexity, and commitment to outcomes.

---

## 3) Pillars (re‑cut with “co‑ambition”)

Replace the previous set with this sharper quartet:

### Pillar 1 — Discipline (Method)
A structured process that respects complexity without becoming rigid.

### Pillar 2 — Presence (Connection)
We listen, we read nuance, we hold the human reality of decisions.

### Pillar 3 — Illumination (Clarity)
We surface signal and explain trade‑offs — so decisions are defensible.

### Pillar 4 — Elevation (Co‑Ambition)
**We share your ambition — and help pull the organisation upward.**  
We don’t just “deliver a hire.” We strengthen judgement, standards, and leadership alignment.

> Key sentence to reuse everywhere:  
> **“We share the ambition — and we spar with you to make it real.”**

---

## 4) Brand manifesto (homepage‑compatible, refined)

**We believe the most important decisions are human.**  
They deserve method — not theatre.  
They deserve standards — without ego.  
They deserve kindness — without compromise.

We don’t claim to “solve” people.  
We choose to understand them.  
We enter the arena with entrepreneurs and decision‑makers —  
not as spectators, but as sparring partners.

We bring structure where there is noise,  
and clarity where there is pressure.  
**Because ambition needs more than talent. It needs judgement.**

---

## 5) Voice update (micro‑rules)

### Add 3 voice traits
- **Engaged** (we’re in it with you)
- **Demanding** (high bar, precise language)
- **Benevolent** (respectful, never cynical)

### Sentence patterns to prefer
- “We challenge the brief.”
- “We make trade‑offs explicit.”
- “We carry the ambition with you.”
- “We raise the standard, then we execute.”

### Avoid
- “discreet” as an identity word  
Use **“confidential by default”** when needed, as a requirement not a personality.
