# Irbis Copywriting Strategy (English First)

> **Synthesis**: Blending Irbis's "Executive Search" expertise, Taylor Shift's "Retail Luxury" precision, and "Enlightened Choices" philosophy of Paris project.

## 1. Verbal Identity

### Primary Tagline
**"Executive Search with Adaptive Precision."**

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
**"The alliance of human intuition and algorithmic precision."**

### Tone of Voice
*   **Prestigious yet Modern**: Luxury codes (sobriety, elegance) mixed with tech vocabulary (precision, data, matching).
*   **"The Lucid Catalyst"**: We don't sell dreams; we reveal data-driven opportunities.
*   **Confidential & Exclusive**: "Privacy by Design".

## 2. Communication Pillars

### A. Adaptive Precision (The "How")
*   **Concept**: No "spray and pray". Every match is calculated across 8 dimensions (Skills, Leadership, Image, etc.).
*   **Wording**: "8D Matching", "Contextual Scoring", "Structural Alignment".
*   **Message**: "Stop searching. Find with certainty."

### B. Absolute Confidentiality (The "Safety")
*   **Concept**: Talents are visible only if they match. Salaries are verified but masked.
*   **Wording**: "Privacy by Design", "Budget Alignment", "Controlled Visibility".
*   **Message**: "Alignment without revelation."

### C. Enlightened Choices (The "Why")
*   **Concept**: Empowering decision-making through data transparency.
*   **Wording**: "Reveal Potential", "Course Hypotheses", "Actionable Clarity".
*   **Message**: "We analyze. We reveal. You decide."
